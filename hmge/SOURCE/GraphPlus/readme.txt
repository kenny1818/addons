Dear Friends,

Whenever I see modern data visualization/dashboard tools,
I wish these features available in HMG.

This week, I started doing my long pending wish of revamping
the Graph library (with the help of our versatile Bos Taurus Library)
by starting from scratch. Like GridPlus library, this is also Object
Oriented.

Hope you like this. Any help in the form of suggestions, test reports,
bug reports, bug fixes, enhancements, help documents and comments are welcome.

I wish to dedicate this library to our beloved friend Esgici.

Some new features:
- Color Themes (just like MS Office 365)
- Grid to Chart support
- Aesthetic look and feel
- Legend and Category Titles
- Font support for title/legend/category
- Switch Rows to Columns to see data in different perspective
and many more.

Forthcoming features: (if time is available and people can help)
- Bar graph
- Funnel Chart
- Doughnut Chart (On seeing the progresswheel sample of Gregory, I hope that will be easy.)
- Area Chart
- Stacked Bar/Column/Area Charts
- Waterfall Model Chart
- XY Scatter Chart
- Stock Chart

Another dream came true with Sun Burst Chart which can represent Hierarchical Data
(like Group->Sub-Group->Head->Value)

For Sun Burst Chart, legends position in the right looks good and logical.
