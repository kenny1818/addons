Little wizard for create the controls

IDE is a useful program but I do not like the result (prg + FMG) it rarely use.

I see that many people use when they need to create a control and then to infiltrate program.

I did something similar to create several controls so look.

Program create test.prg , then copy-paste code into your program.
