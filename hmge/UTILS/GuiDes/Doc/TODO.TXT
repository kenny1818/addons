	* BUGS and necessary enhancements:

		* Add missing MiniGUI controls: RICHEDITBOX, TAB, etc.
		* Check and support missing clauses for already supported controls (e.g.: tree's NODEIMAGES) 
		* Change ID text in OI ControlSelector at ID change. 
		* gWindow:Load method should intercept errors
		* gTextEditor (G_INSPEC.PRG) should prevent opening files larger than EDITBOX's maximum text size
		* AUTOSIZE option should not be used when loading windows, as control's saved WIDTH and HEIGHT 
		should be used. AUTOSIZE should only be used at window creation.

		* Add whether WINDOW SELECTOR, CONTROL SELECTOR, PROPERTIES INSPECTOR should be shown at GUIDES'S 
			start up, to GUIDES.INI
		* Add a TOOL to change control order (i.e. order of tab KEY navigation)

	* Possible enhancements:
		* Ask control caption at control creation. This could be used together with AUTOSIZE feature.
		* When no BACKCOLOR for controls is selected in PREFERENCES WINDOW, use TRANSPARENT if available
		* Same for Windows
		* Save "Last Used styled" in GUIDES.INI and use it at Guides start up
		* Allow running external applications and create a favourite external applications menu
		* Add "Available memory" window
		* Add UNDO/REDO system
		* Write better help system
		* Check whether control NAME is necessary in CONTROL SELECTOR window, and eliminate it if not

	* HBPRINTER support:
		* Create a new class, inherited from gWindow, for HBPRINTER design support.
		* That "window"'s properties should accept page size selection, resolution and so on

	* ARRAY EDITOR
		* Create an ARRAY EDITOR to help in array creation (e.g. for BROWSE controls headers creation), 
		  a BROWSE or GRID control could be used for that.

	* GWindow:
		* Fix 8-elements-array font handling. Default font mechanism must be implemented
		* The ORDER OF THE window CLAUSES HAS CHANGED

			 WINDOW Code tab.
		* Suggest an ALIAS text by default [DONE]
		* VALUE clause should't be saved.
		* Add TOOLTIPs to automatically generated controls

		* Preferences Window/Code Tab: Allow user preferred type of quotes  in MinGUI code creation 
			(single quotes, double quotes)
