* Release 0.2 (2003/03/02) : Among others these are the new changes:

    * Fixed: GuiDes can detect now the path where it has been installed (without saving 
		 any information in the registry). Therefore some bugs related to files not 
		 found (especially "GUIDES.HLP") should be fixed now. 
    * Fixed: A bug that made CONTROL'S defined events to be quoted in MiniGUI export. 
    * Fixed: A bug that made ITEMS property in LISTBOX controls to be non-editable.
    * Fixed: A bug that made VALUE property not to be included in MiniGUI output.
    * Fixed: A bug that made controls "OF" clause to refer to GuiDes internal-window-name instead of
             user-defined window ID.
    * Fixed: A bug that made loaded windows's names to be conflict with existing windows's names. Now, NAME 
             property is always assigned automatically by Guides, since it exists just for internal
             purposes.

    * Changed: "Project folder" is now in "GuiDes" tab.

		    and thus some buttons have been removed.

			Property Inspector. Control and Window Selector can be used to select Controls or Windows.

               Instead they are saved as separate INI-format files.
    * Changed: Several look improvements.
    * Changed: Dragging controls is now possible because of faster control repositioning
    * New: ON SCROLLLEFT, ON SCROLLRIGHT, ON SCROLLUP, ON SCROLLDOWN,
             ON HSCROLLBOX, ON VSCROLLBOX events for windows and VIRTUAL WIDTH/ VIRTUAL HEIGHT properties

             after having saved a style.

    * Fixed: A bug in converting BACKCOLOR and FONTCOLOR to MIniGUI new
             syntax. Fixed by Grigory Filatov.

    * Fixed: A bug in AboutWindow menu checked status.
             Fixed by Grigory Filatov.

    * Fixed: FRAME control MiniGUI code. Fixed by Grigory Filatov.

    * Changed: FRAME control default size is bigger. Changed by Grigory Filatov.

    * Changed: Smaller toolbar icons. Contributed by Grigory Filatov.

    * Added: MenuEditor is working. It is useful for creating Main Menu,
             Notify Menu and Context Menu for windows. It is also used for
             editing the contents of a TREE control.

    * Added: GuiDes help has more and better explanations.


* Release 0.12 (2003/03/02) :

    * Fixed: A bug that made label BACKCOLOR and FONTCOLOR properties not to
             be properly retrieved from FRM files.

    * Fixed: Property Edition bugs. Fixed by Grigory Filatov.

    * Fixed: GPF when double-clicking an empty cell on the Object Inspector

    * Fixed: A bug that made impossible to add controls to a window
             that has been loaded from a file.

    * Changed: BACKCOLOR and FONTCOLOR properties in Exported MiniGUI files,
               to adapt them to release 60.

    * Changed: BMP and ICO are now included in GUIDES.EXE, through resource
               file compilation. Contributed by Grigory Filatov.
    * Changed: WINDOW default position is now always (0,0)

    * Changed: The way GuiDes deals with colors (a color is a number between
               0 and (2^24)-1).

               This effects how colors are saved in FRM files.
               GUIDES.DBF structure has been adapted to this.

    * Changed: The way arrays are saved in FRM files (FONT properties).

               You will NOT be able to load previously saved windows unless
               you by hand change your FRM files. I suggest you FIRSTLY create
               some sample FRM files to see how FONTCOLOR, BACKCOLOR and FONT
               properties are now saved.                

               You will NOT be able to use GUIDES.DBF created by a previous version
               of GuiDes.


    * Changed: GUIDES.BC. You can change how GUIDES.BC points your BCC55 root
               directory from a single line.
    
    * Changed: GuiDes release number appears now on GuiDes main window title.

    * Changed: G_INSPEC.PRG to separate File Inspector behavior.

    * Changed: Control ID appear now on the object Inspector top box.

    * Changed: Window properties edition window.

    * Added: Source distribution includes CHANGLOG.TXT and TODO.TXT.

    * Added: Windows can be saved as XML. This is experimental. A DTD
             and way to parse and retrieve XML files should be
             implemented. 

    * Added: MenuEditor for editing Menus and Trees.

             This is not fully developed yet, so it is not usable for
             retrievable menu creation.

             You can try it and see how it looks like by clicking on
             the statusbar items that appears on every window you create.

    * Added: ID Property to gWINDOW. This allows to specify a Window ID
             different from GuiDes internal name.

    * Added: Tree control. Tree contents cannot be edited as MenuEditor
             is not finished.
