Author:   Grigory Filatov

The 'DBF to XML' program allows you to convert your dbf files to
XML (Extensible Markup Language) format.
XML is a universal data format. It is convenient for a migration
of information  to  a new platform  because  it  is  simple  and
understandable for many other applications.
