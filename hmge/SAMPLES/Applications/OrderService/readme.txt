Grigory,

I am Marcelo Neves, a user of MiniGUI Extended in Brazil,
a long time ago I sent you a complete program for pizzeria
using DBF and CDX to be part of the SAMPLES folder,
the name of the program is SUPER.

Now I want to send another complete program to work with
service orders (useful for commerce that provides services),
using MySQL through the TMySql class.

I hope it helps other programmers.
