Saving Tree to a file
EDK - Sun Apr 11, 2021 5:34 am
 
Below I present the code that allows you to write and read the tree structure to a file in json format.

It is not a ready-made universal tool and it will certainly not work in all applications, but it shows
how the tree structure export / import operation can be quite easily accomplished.

I chose the json format so that tasks would be performed on arrays, but you can successfully
(with a little modification) use a DBF file.
