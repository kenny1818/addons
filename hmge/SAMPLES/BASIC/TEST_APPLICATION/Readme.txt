Application Features
````````````````````
The following are the features which the Test application should demonstrate:

- Resizeable main window, with an empty client area.

- About dialog, with some basic text, an icon, and an “ok” button.

- Windows “visual styles” support, so that controls such as buttons are consistent
  with other Windows applications running with visual styles enabled.

- Version information resource, so that the version information and copyright information
  can be viewed using Windows Explorer.

- Main menu allowing exiting of the application, and the showing of the about dialog.

- Keyboard accelerator “Alt + A” to show the about dialog.

- System menu item allowing the about dialog to be shown.

- Target either 32 bit or 64 bit versions of Windows, without any source code changes.
