  19/04/2020 Add an enhanced demo with Tsbrowse search
  If present an logic field, you can change the color of tsbrowse row
  The searches on tsbrowse are also activated by clicking on the column head
  or by choosing the field in the combobox.
  If the search field is logical, you can search for the value using "1", "T", "ON", "S", "Y", ". T."
  like TRUE, otherwise everything is considered to be FALSE
  If the search field is a date, you can search for total date (28/1/2020), or
  month plus year, or only year (2 or 4 digit), the date separator can be "/" or ".", or "-"
  If the search field is a Number the decimal separator accept "." or "," and expression like >= etc.
  Part of this code is an "academic exercise"
  If you want use a file index comment Line 35  #DEFINE MEM_INDEX
